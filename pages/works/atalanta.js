					Atalanta A.C. (Athletics Club) is an ambitious attempt to create a complete
					modern e-commerce clothing and accessory store for athletes; with user
					authentication.
					<br />
					<br />
					With the help of Sanity.io, a headless CMS/Content management system, I was able
					to easily create a backend to manage, fetch and update different pieces of
					clothing, shoes and accessories.
					<br />
					<br />
					Using React Context and form validation, users are able to create and manage
					their own account, and use this saved information (Cookies) to checkout via
					their debit/credit cards or PayPal account.

				<Paragraph>
					This was my first attempt at creating a Next JS website and learning to use the
					Sanity.io platform, so the experience was rather new and raw. I noticed that
					SSR(Server Side Rendering) was not the optimal choice for fetching the data from
					the backend; which causes data to load slower than anticipated.
					<br />
					<br />
					In future updates, the website will be revamped using ISR (Incremental Static
					Regeneration) so data is readily available on build time, and only gets
					regenerated when the backend is updated; in the case of sales, price markdowns,
					and other content updates. As well as creating more reusable code and templates
					for products, to reduce the unneeded bloat.
